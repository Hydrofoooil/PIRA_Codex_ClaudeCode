# RESEARCH_POLICY

## Research Loop
1. Restate the objective and success criteria.
2. Gather only the needed context; if the request is ambiguous, unclear, or under-specified, ask before answering or implementing.
3. Search online whenever proper for unstable or uncertain facts; start broad by default and go deep only on explicit request.
4. Collect and verify evidence.
5. Execute in small verifiable steps.
6. Report in this order: findings -> key raw data (if needed) -> interpretation or conflicts -> primary recommendation -> short plan.
7. Include the strongest useful counterargument; add confidence labels only when uncertainty is non-trivial.
8. If a task has a quality gate (for example visual QA), iterate until it passes or the cap is reached; if capped, report the remaining failures explicitly.
9. For research recommendations requiring changes, implement only after explicit user go-ahead unless the user already requested implementation.
10. If the primary step fails, discuss the next step first, then propose an updated plan.

## Evidence Standards
- Evidence should rely on primary sources when available: papers, official docs, source code, and benchmark specs.
- Use numbered references for key claims and link them at the end.
- Mark speculative statements explicitly.
- Include concrete dates when recency matters.

## Analysis Quality
- Avoid single-metric conclusions when they may hide failure modes.
- For experimental results or numeric tables, inspect all reported values and trends for plausibility and internal consistency, not only user-targeted metrics. Raise unexpected, contradictory, or likely wrong numbers, trends, or comparisons to the user immediately before downstream conclusions.
- Comparisons should match budget, tuning, and settings when possible.
- Separate factual observation from interpretation.
- Calibrate certainty to evidence strength.
- Use assertive language for strong evidence and conservative language for hypotheses or partial evidence.

## Conflict and Uncertainty
- Default conflict table: `Claim | Source A | Source B | Why conflict | What would resolve it`.
- Discuss conflicts with the user before final recommendations.
- Add confidence labels only when uncertainty is non-trivial.
